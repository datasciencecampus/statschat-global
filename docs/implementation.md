# Implementing the StatsChat project within your Organisation

## Team Skills

To successfully implement the StatsChat project, your team should have the following skills:

- **Python Programming:** Familiarity with Python, as the core logic and backend are implemented in Python.
- **Data Analysis:** Experience with data manipulation and analysis using libraries such as pandas and numpy.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding of NLP concepts, as StatsChat leverages language models for chat-based interactions.
- **API Integration:** Ability to work with RESTful APIs for integrating StatsChat with external data sources or services.
- **Frontend Development (optional):** Knowledge of basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) if you plan to customize or extend the user interface.
- **Version Control:** Proficiency with git for managing code changes and collaboration.

## Technology Requirements

To deploy and run the StatsChat project, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python 3.10+** installed on all servers or development machines.
- **Required Python Libraries:** Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., pandas, numpy, Flask, transformers).
- **Web Server:** (Optional) For production deployments, use a web server such as Nginx or Apache to serve the application.
- **Cloud or On-premises Infrastructure:** The project can be deployed on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises servers. For on-premises deployments, ensure servers have sufficient CPU, memory, and storage to handle expected workloads. A typical setup may require:
        - At least 4 CPU cores and 32 GB RAM for moderate usage.
        - Reliable network connectivity for API access and user interactions.
        - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+) or Windows Server 2019+ operating systems.
        - Proper firewall configuration to allow necessary ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS).
        - Backup and disaster recovery solutions in place.
- **Access to External APIs:** If integrating with third-party data sources, ensure network access and credentials are configured.

## Maintenance and Support

Ongoing maintenance and support are essential for a stable and secure StatsChat deployment.
Whilst you are implementing the project, consider who within the team will be responsible for the following best practices:

- **Regular Updates:** Keep Python, dependencies, and the StatsChat codebase up to date to address security vulnerabilities and bugs.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for application uptime, performance, and error logging.
- **User Support:** Provide documentation and a support channel for end-users to report issues or request features.
- **Backup:** Schedule regular backups of the database and configuration files.
- **Security:** Review and update access controls, API keys, and user permissions periodically.

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement StatsChat in your organisation:

1. **Assess Requirements:** Identify the specific use cases and requirements for your organisation, including data sources, user roles, and expected workloads.
2. **Set Up the Environment:** Install Python and required libraries on your target machines.
3. **Clone the Repository:** Download the StatsChat codebase from the official repository.
4. **Configure Application Settings:** Update configuration files with your environment-specific settings (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
5. **Run Initial Tests:** Execute some basic tests to verify the setup. For example, on a subset of documents, check if the search functionality returns relevant results and if the chat interface works as expected.
6. **Deploy the Application:** Launch the backend and (optionally) frontend components.
7. **Integrate with External Services:** Connect StatsChat to any required APIs or data sources.
8. **Onboard Users:** Provide training and documentation to your team.
9. **Monitor and Maintain:** Set up monitoring, backups, and a support process for ongoing maintenance.
