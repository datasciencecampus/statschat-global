# Running the Flask web interface

In order to run the user UI, which has a website interface that relies on the API,
you can use a sample Flask web interface.
In order to initiate that, make sure that the API is running and then start up the app:

```shell
python flask-app/app.py
```

Then navigage, in your browser to http://localhost:5000.
