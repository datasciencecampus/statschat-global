# Running the Flask web interface

In order to run the user UI, which has a website interface that relies on the API,
you can use a sample Flask web interface. You may need to do this in 2 separate terminals.
In order to initiate that, **[make sure that the API is running first](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/statschat-global/blob/cloud_fix/docs/running_api.md)** and then start up the app:

```shell
python flask-app/app.py
```

Then navigage, in your browser to http://localhost:5000.
