## Installation on Mac

The project requires specific versions of some packages so it is recommended to
set up a virtual environment.  Using venv and pip:

```shell
python3.11 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install .
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are doing development work on `statschat`, you should install the
> package locally as editable with our optional `dev` dependencies:
> ```shell
> python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
> ```

## Installation on Windows

The project requires specific versions of some packages so it is recommended to
set up a virtual environment.

Before you download the `statschat-ke` repo you should have the following:

- Python (version 3.11)

For now, we can only guarantee the project will work with Python 3.11.


### Getting Python

In order to get the relevant Python version (3.11.10 is the assumed version),
you will need to have the Anaconda Navigator installed. Alternatively you can
use [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

Once this is installed, you can then launch the PowerShell Prompt.
Use the following command to create a new python environment with Python 3.11:

```bash
conda create --name statchat_dev python=3.11
```

This will create a new virtual environment whose name is statchat_dev.
If the new environment hasn't auto activated, run the following:

```bash
conda activate statchat_dev
```

This will activate the statchat_dev virtual environment.
You can also use this to switch back to the statchat_dev environment if you have switched to another.

Check that you have the correct python version (currently 3.11.10) by running the following.

```bash
python --version
```

If you have anything below 3.10 or equal or greater than 3.12 then the project may have issues.
If this is the case, please re-create the virtual environment ensuring that the python version is specified.

### Installing statchat

The codebase is meant to also run as a python library, in order to install this
you will then need to run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

> ```shell
> pip install -e .

## Pre-commit actions

This repository contains a configuration of pre-commit hooks. These are
language agnostic and focussed on repository security (such as detection of
passwords and API keys).

If approaching this project as a developer, you are encouraged to install and
enable `pre-commits` by running the following in your shell:

1. Install `pre-commit`:
   ```shell
   pip install pre-commit
   ```
2. Enable `pre-commit`:
   ```shell
   pre-commit install
   ```

Once pre-commits are activated, whenever you commit to this repository a series of checks will be executed.
The use of active pre-commits are highly encouraged.
If any of the hooks fail, the commit will be aborted, and you will need to fix the issues before trying again.

You can also run the pre-commit hooks manually using the following command:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This command runs all the pre-commit hooks on all the files in the repository,
allowing you to check your code before committing.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your development environment is set up to use the pre-commit hooks,
helping to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-commit hooks execute Python, so it expects a working Python build.

## Setup Vector Store

To web scrape the source documents run **`pdf_runner.py`**. Ensure that the **`PDF_FILES_MODE`** (in `main.toml`) is set to the desired option **"SETUP"**.

    ```shell
    python statschat/pdf_runner.py
    ```

This script will webscrape PDF documents from the website, convert them to JSON files and either append or replace the vector store - based on the **PDF_FILES_MODE** parameter.

**PDF_FILES_MODE** = **"SETUP"** -> Will scrape all pdf files from the website and reset the vector store, creating a new one from the PDF documents that are scraped and processed into JSON files.

> [!NOTE]
> YOU WILL ONLY NEED TO DO THE VECTORE STORE SETUP ONCE
> AFTERWARDS IT WILL ONLY NEED TO BE UPDATED
